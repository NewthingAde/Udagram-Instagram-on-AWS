#  Udagram Image Filtering Microservice-on-AWS

This is a cloud-based application for uploading, listing, and filtering images. This Project uses a Node.js/Express, a popular JavaScript framework for networked application development to develop this application. A REST API to issue commands using HTTP, store data in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Data Service (RDS) and S3, extend the codebase with secure authentication sign-on features, and deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.


## Getting Started

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:

1. The Simple Frontend

2. The RestAPI Backend

3. The Image Filtering Microservice
