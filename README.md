#  Udagram Image Filtering Microservice-on-AWS

This is a cloud-based application for uploading, listing, and filtering images. This Project uses a Node.js/Express, a popular JavaScript framework for networked application development to develop this application. A REST API to issue commands using HTTP, store data in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Data Service (RDS) and S3, extend the codebase with secure authentication sign-on features, and deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.


## Getting Started

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:

1. [The Simple Frontend](https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-frontend)
A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend. [Covered in the course]

2. [The RestAPI Backend](https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/exercises/udacity-c2-restapi), a Node-Express server which can be deployed to a cloud service. [Covered in the course]

3. [The Image Filtering Microservice](https://github.com/udacity/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code), the final project for the course. It is a Node-Express application which runs a simple script to process images. [Your assignment]


### Setup Node Environment

 1. Create a new node server. In thr terninal we do the following 

    - Initialize a new project: 
    
                                   npm i
                                 
   - Run the development server with 
      
                                 npm run dev


### Create a new endpoint in the server.ts file



### Deploying your system




### Refactor the course RESTapi



### Authentication



### Custom Domain Name
